       <li>He looked at it carefully, then he said</li>
       <li>No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another.</li>
       <li>So I made another drawing.</li>
       <li>My friend smiled gently and indulgently.</li>
       <li>You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns.</li>
       <li>So then I did my drawing over once more.</li>
       <li>But it was rejected too, just like the others.</li>
       <li>This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time.</li>

       <li>because I was in a hurry to start taking</li>
       <li>my engine apart</li>
       <li>So I tossed off this drawing.</li>

   <p><u>It took <span>me a long time to</span></u> <b>learn</b> where he came from. <i>The little prince, who asked me so many questions</i>, never <mark>'seemed to hear the ones I asked him.'</mark> It <s>was from words dropped by chance</s> that, <em>little</em> by little, <strong>"everything was revealed"</strong> to me.</p>

   <p>And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.</p>

   <p>You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the "other planets." I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.</p>
